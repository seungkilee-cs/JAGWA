# Development Notes â€” October 7, 2025

## Summary
- Added dedicated Svelte stores for hourly forecasts and AQI (`hourlyForecasts`, `aqiValue`, `resetWeatherState()` in `src/lib/stores/weatherStore.ts`).
- Refactored `src/App.svelte` to rely on the new stores, normalize user input, and improve loading/error/info messaging.
- Enhanced `src/components/PrecipitationChart.svelte` to rebuild/update the Chart.js instance when forecast data changes and to clean up correctly.
- Confirmed mock data integration keeps the app functional without an API key.
- Integrated UV index support via `weatherService.getUVIndex()`, `uvIndex` store, and new `UVIndexDisplay` component shown alongside AQI.
- Added `PrecipitationAmountChart.svelte` stacked bar visualization and integrated it into `App.svelte` alongside probability chart.
- Built `DailyForecastCarousel.svelte` for five-day card carousel with detail pane, wired to new daily forecast store integration.
- Shifted overall UI toward an Apple Weather aesthetic: glassmorphic hero in `WeatherDisplay.svelte`, upgraded search bar, gradient background, and refined metric cards.
- Enhanced daily carousel with swipe gestures, animated transitions, and sunrise/sunset indicators.

## Follow-ups
- Begin UV index integration and additional metrics per `docs/implementation-plan.md`.
- Consider adding unit tests for the new store logic and chart rendering behavior.
- Style/animation polish for `UVIndexDisplay` and consider alerting when values exceed safe thresholds.
- Evaluate dynamic legends/tooltips for precipitation amount chart and support for longer forecast windows.
- Evaluate adding hourly/daily sync animations and caching daily data locally.
