# JAGWA - Just Another Generic Weather App

Just another generic weather app, but mine.

## Motivation

I'm a South Korean national, but I have spent my entire adult life in the United States and have accustomed myself to 'Murican Freedom Units. Among them, the most unintuitive and cumbersome unit is the temperature: Farenheit and Celcius. It is annoying to have to look at the temperature and talk to a friend, and have to convert it every single time to reference how hot or cold it is.

## Rough Goal

I want to make something that looks like iPadOS app, but more intuitive and better navigating for all parts I need (UV, Air Quality, Temperature, Precipitations)
